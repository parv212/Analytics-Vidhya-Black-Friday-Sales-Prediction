# Analytics-Vidhya-Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction

In This project I downloaded the Black Friday sales prediction data from analytics vidhya in which I had to predict the purchase amount of the customers for the company. I explored the data and got insights through Exploratory Data Analysis and understood the data and then applied Linear Regression, Random Forest and XGBosst for prediction.
